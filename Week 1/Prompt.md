### This week I will be making an app based on a topic from James Altucher's book [Choose Yourself](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17977529-choose-yourself)

I would explain the premise of what this is about, but I feel that James says it much better than I can. You can find the clip here: [clip](http://a.co/1T7aTyE)

** Goals: **
- Be able to add, delete and change items in the list.
- Have a main dashboard that shows all past lists.
- In list view, be able to see the list, date created and last edit.
