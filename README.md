# An app a week challenge

- - -

#### An app a week challenge is made to be a way to get on a very fast paced developoment schedule

**How this works**
- Sunday morning I will issue what that week's app will be.
- From the moment the prompt is issued until Suturday night at 23:59 whatever timezone I am in, (Currently MST -7:00) I will have to work on my app.
- All files used will be uploaded to this project's Git repository.

**Rules**
1. No changes, additions or deletions can be made after the week is through
2. There is no limit to what technologies are used
